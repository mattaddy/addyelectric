        "Solar photovoltaic systems are especially enjoyable to me. As an electrician for many years and moving from New York to California where there is a lot of sun, I see a lot of potential in solar. I take pleasure in saving money and providing clean, sustainable, energy for people. Allowing the sun to produce power that can be used in a home has interested me for years. I look forward to providing quality products and excellent workmanship for everything we do. Thanks for considering Addy Electric for your next project."
